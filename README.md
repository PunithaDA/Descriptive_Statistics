## Exploring Factors Influencing Employee Salaries
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing information about employees, including their age, blood group, healthy eating habits,
active lifestyle, and salary.The primary focus is to explore potential relationships between these variables. Additionally, we aim to identify any anomalies or discrepancies in the dataset that could provide valuable insights for HR and management decision-making processes.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Removal of duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- Handling of missing values.
- Ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
### Descriptive Statistics:
- Computation of summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) for each variable.
- Visualization of variable distributions using histograms, count plots, and scatter plots.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Investigation of relationships between variables, with a focus on healthy eating habits, active lifestyle, and salary.
- Identification of patterns and trends within the dataset.

### Tools:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook for code development and documentation.
